"""Regression tests for shipped-today scoping (GOAL.md invariant 3).

Rules locked in here for `filter_shipped_by_slot`:

  - An order counts as shipped if its status is in the shipped set (and NOT in
    hold, waiting, processing, or cancelled/refunded).
  - Orders whose status is hold, waiting, pending, or processing NEVER count as shipped,
    even if they have a consignment ID.
  - "Shipped today" uses the effective date (modification date, falling back to
    creation date) matched against today's BD calendar date — slot-independent,
    so orders placed days ago but dispatched today still count.
  - Prev / comparison modes scope shipped orders to the operational slot window.
  - A user-selected custom date range scopes shipped orders by effective date.

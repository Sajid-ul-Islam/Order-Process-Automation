"""Regression test: keep unused imports (ruff F401) out of the codebase.

The source tree was cleaned of dead imports (see DEAD_CODE_REPORT.md — August
2026 audit). This test re-runs the same `ruff check --select F401` gate so any
new unused import fails CI instead of silently accumulating.

The lint scope matches the project's pre-commit configuration
(``app.py | src/ | scripts/``). The test skips when ruff is not installed
(e.g. runtime-only environments); CI installs `requirements_dev.txt`, which
includes ruff, so the guard is active there.

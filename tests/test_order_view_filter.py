"""Regression tests for the consolidated Live Dashboard order-view filtering.

These lock in the refactor from the dashboard audit:
- ``apply_order_view`` / ``apply_order_view_comparison`` are the single source
  of truth for the "All Orders / Shipped / Processing" selector (replacing the
  three previously duplicated implementations).
- KPI card labels in ``render_operational_metrics`` must reflect the actual
  ``live_order_filter`` values ("Shipped"/"Processing"), not the dead
  "Shipped Only"/"Processing Only" strings.

The filter helper is exercised with a lightweight fake Streamlit session state so
it never touches disk or the network.
